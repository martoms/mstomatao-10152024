## This app uses H2Database

### To run this app, kindly open two terminals having the same path as this file.

### In the first terminal, run the command below:
`npm run server`
-- Before running the next command, kindly open in the browser `http://localhost:9000/` to initialize the Database
-- Expect that after initializing the database, it will show `TO DO: Action not implemented yet.` When it appears, the server is already ok.

### In the second terminal, run the command below:
`npm run client`
-- You may now open the app in `http://localhost:5173/`
